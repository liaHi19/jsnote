**JBook**

##

This is an iteractive coding environment. You can write JavaScript, see it executed and write documentation using markdown.

- Click any text cell to edit it
- The code in each code editor is all joined together into one file. If you define variable in cell #1, you can refer to it in any following cell
- You can show any React component, string, number or anything else by calling the show function.
- Reorder or delete cells using the button on the top right
- Add new cells by hovering on the divider between each cell

All your changes get saved to the file you opened JBook with. If you run npx jsnote-liahi serve test.js, all the text and code will be saved in test.js file.

## Getting Started

First, install the program:

```bash
npx jsnotes-liahi serve

or in root folder
npm run start
```
